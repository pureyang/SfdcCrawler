This is an example crawler that provides two data sources:

* a very simple crawler for local file system,
* a "random" datasource that produces a random number of example documents.

To see this crawler in action please put the example-crawler.jar in the "app/crawlers"
directory of your LucidWorks installation, and restart LucidWorks. The admin UI for
data sources should show new data source types "xfile" and "xrandom" provided by
a "lucid.example" crawler.
